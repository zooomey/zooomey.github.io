        <h2>My Interests</h2>
        <h3>Areas I'm Interested in Working In:</h3>
        <h4>Although I have a strong background in Production Engineering and Site Reliability Engineering, I would love to do more complicated backend work. I can pick up anything, but what matters to me most is the nature of the project/work itself.</h4>
        <h4>Would be interested in learning either C# or C++ (preferably C#), perhaps some experience with AI/ML is in play, but that's because I'm just curious - some database work (SQL) or framworks (React/Angular) might be cool too.</h4>
