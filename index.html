        "...And sometimes the player believed the universe had spoken to it through the zeros and ones,<br>
        through the electricity of the world, through the scrolling words on a screen at the end of a dream<br>
        and the universe said I love you<br>
        and the universe said you have played the game well<br>
        and the universe said everything you need is within you<br>
        and the universe said you are stronger than you know<br>
        and the universe said you are the daylight<br>
        and the universe said you are the night<br>
        and the universe said the darkness you fight is within you<br>
        and the universe said the light you seek is within you<br>
        and the universe said you are not alone<br>
        and the universe said you are not separate from every other thing<br>
        and the universe said you are the universe tasting itself, talking to itself, reading its own code<br>
        and the universe said I love you because you are love.<br>
        And the game was over and the player woke up from the dream. And the player began a new dream.<br>
        And the player dreamed again, dreamed better. And the player was the universe. And the player was love.<br>
        You are the player.<br>
        Wake up."<br>
